    take an example of 62|1|5430 ------> 62|3|5430 swap 1 and 3        -------->62|3|0145 reverse after swapping from 3 new position
    
    Note in permutation: we choose a smaller element before larger to form a increasing sequence.
    
    lets say we start from right to left for example 5430 we know that 5>4>3>0 this means we are having greater element at left position only when it has already chosen a smaller element before.
    
    62|1|5430
    However, we we meet 1 from right to left we see that 1 is smaller that its next element that means in
    1 search space there is possibility of a larger element which we can check from end as smaller numbers would be from end. 
    
    After replacing 1 with 3 we see that 62|3|5410. we should reverse after 3 as smaller numbers should before to form a small number.
