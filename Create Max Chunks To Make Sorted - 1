/*
Let say after sorting:

[4,3,2,1,0] => [0,1,2,3,4]

Now we can maintain a arr (indices) where we stored the index number of the number in the actual array

Now try loop through from index = 0 and check what where was it 0 present in the array. let it was index1

Now from index to index1 we need to sure every element has to be within this range otherwise index1 increases (Basically our chunck size would increase)
